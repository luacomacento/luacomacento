## Hello, beautiful people! :wave:

<p>I'am a 24-year-old technology enthusiast from Belo Horizonte, Brazil.</p>
<p>Having graduated in Cinema at the University, and with a pending masters degree in Communications, I have decided to do a carreer-shift in order to follow a dream from my childhood: to work with web development.
Currently I am a student at <a href="https://www.betrybe.com">Trybe</a>, a school that aims to develop their students to become great professionals in the tech field.</p>
<p>Sister to two teachers, I like to say it was impossible for me not to fall in love with education, and I aim to help people reach their maximum potential in all the ways I can. Which means I work hard on developing my communication, collaboration and leadership skills :)</p>
